This repository contains the files for creating the **`Renewable Energy Dashboard using Excel`**

In this project, we will complete the following tasks:

* Clean the raw data in Excel (remove duplicates, standardize data using nested IF(), etc.).
* Explore the dataset using Pivot Tables.
* Create two inteactive dashboards -
  1. Renewable Energy Dashboard 2023
  2. Renewable Energy Regional Focus 2023

## About the Dataset
I have downloaded the data from [International Renewable Energy Agency]('https://www.irena.org/Data/').
The raw dataset looks like this - 

1. [Renewable Energy Raw Dataset](https://github.com/YatinShekhar/Renewable-Energy-Analysis/blob/main/raw-files/Renewable%20Energy%20Raw%20Dataset.xlsx)
2. [Renewable Energy Investment Raw Dataset](https://github.com/YatinShekhar/Renewable-Energy-Analysis/blob/main/raw-files/Renewable%20Investments%20Raw%20Dataset.xlsx)
3. [Renewable Energy Jobs Dataset](https://github.com/YatinShekhar/Renewable-Energy-Analysis/blob/main/raw-files/Renewable%20Energy%20Jobs%20Dataset.xlsx)

## Power Pivot
After downloading the raw dataset, it was loaded into `Power Pivot` for cleaning. After investing meaningful time in cleaning the dataset, 
the cleaned dataset is here:

1. [Renewable Energy Clean Dataset](https://github.com/YatinShekhar/Renewable-Energy-Analysis/blob/main/clean-files/Additonal%20Data%20For%20Cleaning.xlsx)
2. [Renewable Investment Clean Dataset](https://github.com/YatinShekhar/Renewable-Energy-Analysis/blob/main/clean-files/Renewable%20Investments%20Clean%20Dataset.xlsx)

For cleaning our data much more easily and swiftly, we created an additonal data table using Power Pivot:

## Insights üîé

### 1. Growth in Renewable Capacity (2000‚Äì2023)

* Most growth observed post-2010, reflecting global push toward clean energy.
* `Solar` and `Wind` show the most significant growth after 2010.
* `Hydro` remains relatively stable but is still a major contributor.

### 2. % Renewable Increase in 2023

Solar Capacity increasing exponentially over years. In 2023, there was a rise of `32%` in Solar Energy capacity.


### 3. Investment Hub for Renewable Energy

`Brazil` has received the highest investment for renewable energy that is `46 Billion dollars` followed by `India`

### 4. Jobs in Renewable Energy

* `Solar Capacity` has generated the highest number of jobs in renewable sector. It has created almost `6 million` jobs in the sector.
* `2013` created 8 million jobs in Reneeable whereas `2023` created approximately 16 million jobs, `Solar` being the major contributor.
