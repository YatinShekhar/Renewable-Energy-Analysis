# Renewable Energy Dashboard 2023

This repository contains the files for creating the Renewable Energy Dashboard using Excel.

In this project, we will complete the following tasks:

* Clean the raw data in Excel (remove duplicates, standardize data using nested IF(), etc.).
* Explore the dataset using Pivot Tables.
* Create two inteactive dashboards -
  1. Renewable Energy Dashboard 2023
  2. Renewable Energy Regional Focus 2023
