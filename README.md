# Overview 📋
* This project aims to analyze global trends in renewable energy generation, investment, and employment from 2000 to 2023 using an interactive Excel dashboard.
* Covers multiple renewable sources — Hydropower, Solar, Wind, Bioenergy, and others — across different countries and region

# About the Dataset 
I have downloaded the data from [International Renewable Energy Agency]('https://www.irena.org/Data/').
The raw dataset looks like this - 

* [Renewable Energy Raw Dataset](https://github.com/YatinShekhar/Renewable-Energy-Analysis/blob/main/raw-files/Renewable%20Energy%20Raw%20Dataset.xlsx)
* [Renewable Energy Investment Raw Dataset](https://github.com/YatinShekhar/Renewable-Energy-Analysis/blob/main/raw-files/Renewable%20Investments%20Raw%20Dataset.xlsx)
* [Renewable Energy Jobs Dataset](https://github.com/YatinShekhar/Renewable-Energy-Analysis/blob/main/raw-files/Renewable%20Energy%20Jobs%20Dataset.xlsx)

# Power Pivot 
After downloading the raw dataset, it was loaded into `Power Pivot` for cleaning. After investing meaningful time in cleaning the dataset, 
the cleaned dataset is here:

* [Renewable Energy Clean Dataset](https://github.com/YatinShekhar/Renewable-Energy-Analysis/blob/main/clean-files/Additonal%20Data%20For%20Cleaning.xlsx)
* [Renewable Investment Clean Dataset](https://github.com/YatinShekhar/Renewable-Energy-Analysis/blob/main/clean-files/Renewable%20Investments%20Clean%20Dataset.xlsx)

For cleaning our data much more easily and swiftly, we created an additonal data table using Power Pivot:
